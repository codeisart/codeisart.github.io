      <description>After a long hiatus, I’ve decided to restart my blog.
My old web presence was proving a bit old and dusty. Having finally realized the future was kicking Wordpress well and truly to the curb, I had started down a path of Octopress. This however ended shortly after it began, so finally I’ve deleted the old pages and started a fresh. It’s only taken 7 years.
I’d been using HUGO at home for our internal “landing” pages, so I thought it was high time that it was used for something a bit more public facing.</description>
